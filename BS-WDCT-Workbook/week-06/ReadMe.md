# Week 6 Overview

Second week of React. We will be looking closely into Client Side Routing, React Router, Storing Data in the Browser and Axios.

## Prerequisites
- Install the `CORS Toggle` extension in your Chrome browser

## This Week's Labs

1. [Lab 1: React Component Lifecycle](./labs/lab-01.md)
2. [Lab 2: Client Side Routing](./labs/lab-02.md)
3. [Lab 3: React Router](./labs/lab-03.md)
4. [Lab 4: Client Side Data Storage](./labs/lab-04.md)
5. [Lab 5: Web Requests with Axios](./labs/lab-05.md)

## Resources

#### Review Questions

1. How does navigating using client side routing differ from navigating using express routes on our server?
2. Why does the react-router need the browserHistory object? What does it use it for?
3. Currently, when we navigate away from a component, changes we have made are lost. What are some ways we can work around this behaviour?
4. Compare and contrast 1) localStorage, 2) sessionStorage, and 3) cookies.
5. What does REST stand for? Broadly speaking, what is it?
6. How does the express modular router help us organize our node/express server code?
7. What are some advantages to using promises over the callback pattern?
