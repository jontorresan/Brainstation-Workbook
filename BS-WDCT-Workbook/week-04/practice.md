### 2: `caesars.js`
- Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique based on shifting each character by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example: `a + 3 = d`, `o + 3 = r`, `z + 3 = c`
- Create a function that takes in a sentence and a key, and outputs the sentence after it has been encrypted with the key. 

---
### 3: `primes.js`
- Did you know there is a [hefty prize](https://www.eff.org/awards/coop) for the person who discovers the next prime number? 
- Create a function that takes in a number and outputs all the [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) from 0 to the given number. 

---
### 4: `timeZones.js`
-  Create a function that outputs different times for 3 different cities. 
```
Time at {place1} is {time} o'clock.
Time at {place2} is {time} o'clock.
Time at {place3} is {time} o'clock.
```

---
### 5: `noCharacters.js`
- Create a function that returns the string: `Hello world!`... WITHOUT using the given word in the return statement! You may NOT use alphabet characters to represent the string that you need to output.

---
### 6: `randomWinner.js`
- Write a program that takes in an array of names. Use this array to generate a random winner. 
- Implement a feature to delay the output of the random winner and instead returns `please wait, shuffling names`
- After 3 seconds, present the winner's name 
**Bonus**: Add some flare to the winner's output
