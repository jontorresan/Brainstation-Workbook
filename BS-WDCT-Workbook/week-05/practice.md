### 3: `pigLatin.js`
- Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".
- Create a function that takes in a string and translates it into Pig Latin. Words beginning with consonants would change as follows: `hello -> ellohay, less -> esslay` Words beginning with consonant clusters would change as follows: `please -> easeplay, fruit -> uitfray, smoothie -> oothiesmay`
