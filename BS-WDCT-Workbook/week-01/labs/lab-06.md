# Week 1 > Lab 6

### Multi-page Portfolio Website
We will be adding new pages to our portfolio and linking to the pages using relative paths.

#### Objective
This lab will show you how to link to other html pages using the anchor tag, and help you to understand relative paths.

#### Prerequisites
- Continue working on the portfolio lab that we started in Lab 1.

#### Requirements - Multi-page
Let's link up your pages to the Navbar so that we can navigate properly. Remember to attach the head and Navbar sections to your other pages as well!

![Simple Nav](../../public/img/simplenav.png)

- Create two new files in your *portfolio project* folder, called `about.html` and `contact.html`
- Make sure that these new pages are set up to use Bootstrap and any other external CSS files
- Add an `h1` with *About Page* and *Contact Page* as titles in their respective pages
- *About* should link to `about.html`
- *Contact* should link to `contact.html`
