# Week 1 > Lab 3

### Build a BrainStation Landing Page
This lab will bring together all of the previous lessons on HTML and CSS into one page. For practice we will build a BrainStation Landing Page.

#### Objective
This lab will help you practice your basic HTML/CSS skills including how you structure a web page, including images and links, using the box model, and positioning elements

#### Prerequisites
- In your `/brainstation/labs` folder, create a directory called `bs-landing-page`
- In the `bs-landing-page`, create a file called `index.html`
- Open up `index.html` in VSCode

####

Provided with the design below, create a working HTML page

![Portfolio Page Example](../../public/img/lab-03-screenshot.png)

- You can download the BrainStation logo and header background from [here](https://github.com/jbluks/BS-WDCT-Workbook/tree/master/public/resources/week-01/lab-03)
- Create the basic HTML structure for your web page with `<head>` and `<body>` tags.
- The header must be fixed to the top of the pages
- The background image should scale based on the size of the browser
- For the the Navigation Sidebar the links should be underlined when hovered over (Hint: Look up [:hover](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) and [text-decoration](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-decoration.asp))
- The course "boxes" should wrap as the width of the browser shrinks
- Try using HTML 5 semantic elements as described [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp).
