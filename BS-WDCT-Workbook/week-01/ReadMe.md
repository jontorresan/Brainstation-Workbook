# Week 1 Overview

Welcome to your first week!

## Prerequisites
- VSCode set up
- GitHub account created, and Git is set up on your computer
- Local file structure set up for labs/assignments/projects

#### Recommended File Structure

It is recommended that you create a directory that contains all of your work from this course as a way of keeping organized. The following is a suggested file structure that you can use.

```
/user
  /projects
  /brainstation
    /assignments
      /assignment1
      /assignment2
      etc..
    /labs
      /week1
        /lab1
        /lab2
      /week2
        /lab1
        /lab2
      etc..
    /practice
```
You will use `/brainstation` for any class work, and `/projects` for any of your own personal projects.
Within `/brainstation`, you can keep your `/assignments`, `/labs`, and `/practice`.
It is recommended that all folder names be in lower case and without spaces. This is to make life easier when you're changing directories at the terminal.
