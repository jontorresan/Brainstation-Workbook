# Programming Practice

### 1: `palindromes.js`
- Create a function that takes in a string and returns a statement that verifies if the word is a palindrome or not. Palindromes are words that are read the same way forwards or backwards (such as: 'Racecar', 'Dr. Awkward','Yo, banana boy', 'Borrow or rob?')

---
### 2: `regex1.js`
- Without searching online for a solution (you may use only https://regexr.com/ for your source of information), create a function that takes in a sentence and returns a boolean if it contains the word 'javascript'. Use regular expressions and [String.match()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_match.asp)

---
### 3: `secondVowel.js`
- Create a function that takes in a sentence and replaces every 2nd vowel with a different random vowel. (e.g. 'The quick brown fox jumped' ==> 'The qaick bruwn fox jamped')

---
### 4: `billCalculator.js`
-  Create a function that takes in a parameter and calculates the tip, tax, and grand total of a bill. You can use 13% for the tax, and 15% for the tip.
- **Bonus:** Take in another parameter to adjust the tip and tax %, respectively. 

---
### 5: `currentTime.js`
- Create a function that take a callback as a parameter and passes the current time to the callback every second.
- The function should return a value that can be used to stop the function from running every second.
- The callback function should print out the provided time.
- *Hint*: Try using `setInterval` and `clearInterval`

---
### 6: `fizzBuzz.js`
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, and replaces multiples of 3 with 'fizz', multiples of 5 with 'buzz', and multiples of both 3 and 5 with 'fizzbuzz. 
- **Bonus**: Try solving this problem without using an if/else statement.
