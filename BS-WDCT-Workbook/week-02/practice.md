# Programming Practice

#### Prerequisites
- In your `/brainstation/practice` folder, create new files for the following problems in their own individual files. You should name the files according to the below.
- Alternatively, you can use [REPL](https://repl.it/) for these practice questions

### 1: `randomNums.js`
- Create a function that returns an array of 20 numbers, with random digits between 1-9 then assign the array output as a variable
- Hint: [Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)
- **Bonus:** Write your function to create an array of length n given a parameter n

---
### 2: `mostRecurring.js`
- Using the array returned from the previous function, find the most recurring number in the array

---
### 3: `removeDuplicates.js`
- Using the same array from before, create a function that knocks out any duplicate numbers and returns a new array containing only unique numbers

---
### 4: `randomWinner.js`
- Create a variable called 'names' and assign it an array with 10 names.
- Using the array, create a function that picks a random name and returns something like: `Jon is the lucky winner!`
- Hint: Try using Javascript [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) for your string

---
### 5: `mergeArrays.js`
- Create two arrays of equal size with some random numbers. You can use your function from Part 1, or simply create two arrays manually.
- Write a function that takes two parameters, `arr1`, `arr2`, that are both arrays, and merges the arrays together into one array.
- Sort the merged array from lowest number to highest number, and return the array
- Hint: While you can use [Array.sort()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp), try sorting without the built in Javascript sort.
