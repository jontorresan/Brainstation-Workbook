# BrainStation Workbook

Welcome to BrainStation! This workbook is a collection of resources designed to guide you through the web development curriculum each week. You will use this to access instructions for weekly labs, assignments, and coding challenges. There are also helpful cheatsheets, resources, and review questions. As you work through the exercises in this workbook, you will gain the skills and knowledge that you need to enter the world of web development and ultimately land your first tech job.

## What's in here?

### Labs

> Labs are in-class small problems that you can solve individually or with a group. Labs are **not marked**. We encourage sharing ideas and logic between your peers to expand each other's understanding of the subject.

### Practice Questions

> Weekly coding challenges that you can complete to develop your programming skills, and analytical, logical, problem solving thinking. These are optional, but important to begin gaining mastery of general programming and Javascript.

### Review Questions

> Review questions are a series of short questions to help solidify the fundamental terms and concepts of web development. These questions represent fundamental knowledge that you should know as an aspiring Web Developer. There will be mock interviews at the end of the program where you will participate in a technical interview. You will be asked a selection of questions from these review questions.

### Cheatsheets and Documentation
> Cheatsheets contain a collection of terms, tips and best practices that help you navigate all the new terms and commands that you are learning. Official Documentation is also critical to understanding how to use different web technologies.
